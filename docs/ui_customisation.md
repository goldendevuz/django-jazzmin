# UI Tweaks

There are various things you can do to change the look and feel of your admin when using jazzmin, some are structural
changes

## UI Customizer

Jazzmin has a built in UI configurator, mimicked + enhanced from [adminlte demo](https://adminlte.io/themes/v3/index3.html),
that allows you to customise parts of the interface interactively.

To enable this, set `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS["show_ui_builder"] = True` and there will be an icon in the top right of the screen
that allows you to customise the interface.

When your happy with your customisations, press the "Show Code" button, and it will give you a code snippet to put
into your settings that will persist these customisations beyond page refresh.

## Themes

With the ui customiser enabled (see above), you can try out different bootswatch themes, and combine the theme with our
other UI tweaks.

### Color scheme (light / dark)

Any Bootswatch theme can be shown in light or dark. Jazzmin sets Bootstrap’s `data-bs-theme` on the `<html>` element
to `"light"` or `"dark"`, so the same theme adapts to the chosen color scheme.

- **`default_theme_mode`** in `JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS`: `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"auto"`. With `"auto"`, the scheme follows
  the system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`). Default is `"light"`.
- The UI customizer lets users switch between Light, Dark, and System; the choice is stored in `localStorage` and can be
  copied into settings via “Show code”.

Example: default to dark, with one theme for everyone:

```python
JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS = {
    ...
    "theme": "flatly",
    "default_theme_mode": "dark",
}
```

Example: follow system preference:

```python
JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS = {
    ...
    "theme": "flatly",
    "default_theme_mode": "auto",
}
```

**Migration from `dark_mode_theme`:** If you had `dark_mode_theme` set (e.g. `"darkly"`), it is deprecated and no longer used. For the same behaviour (dark theme when the user’s system prefers dark), set `default_theme_mode": "auto"` and remove `dark_mode_theme`. If you do not update your config, Jazzmin will treat existing `dark_mode_theme` as `default_theme_mode": "auto"` and log a deprecation warning.

You can preview any of the available themes on your site using the UI Customizer (see above), or view them on bootswatch
below.

## DIY with custom CSS/JS

If there are things you need to do with CSS/JS, but want to avoid overriding the templates yourself, you can include a
custom CSS and/or JS file, just pass a relative path to your files e.g:

```python
"custom_css": "common/css/main.css",
"custom_js": "common/js/main.js"
```

Into your jazzmin settings (Ensure these files can be found by the static file finder)

If you want to manually tweak CSS styles for a particular theme, you can start your CSS rule with
`body.theme-<themename>` e.g:

```css
body.theme-darkly p {
    color: pink;
}
```

To target dark color scheme (when `data-bs-theme="dark"` is set on the document), use:

```css
html[data-bs-theme="dark"] body.theme-darkly p {
    color: pink;
}
```
